# xcodeo

xcodeo is a cli tool to open a folder in Xcode. It does not actually open the specified folder, but only searches the folder for Xcode project or workspace files. 
There are the commands `xcodeop /path/to/folder/` (search the current directory for Xcode project files) and `xcodeow /path/to/folder/` (search the current directory for Xcode workspace files).
